# 🌐 Cloud-Based Task Manager

The **Cloud-Based Task Manager** is an innovative platform designed to enhance team efficiency and organization. Leveraging the MERN stack and modern frontend technologies, this solution provides a seamless experience for administrators and users, fostering collaboration and productivity.

## 🚀 Features

- 👤 **User and Admin Management**: Create, manage, and control user and admin accounts, including enabling, disabling, and deleting accounts.
- 📋 **Task Management**: Assign tasks to users, update task details and status, and label tasks as to-do, in progress, or completed.
- ⭐ **Priority and Sub-Tasks**: Set task priority levels (high, medium, normal, low) and manage sub-tasks for detailed task management.
- 📂 **Asset Management**: Upload and manage task-related assets, such as images.
- 💬 **Communication and Collaboration**: Add comments or chat on tasks to enhance team communication.
- 🔒 **Secure Authentication and Role-Based Access**: Secure user login with role-based access control, ensuring appropriate permissions for all users.
- 🛡️ **Profile and Password Management**: Update user profiles and change passwords securely.
- 📊 **Interactive Dashboard**: Summarize user activities and filter tasks by status: to-do, in progress, or completed.
- 🔍 **Task Access Control**: Users can view tasks but cannot access detailed information or interact with tasks unless they are assigned to that specific task; non-assigned users will see the task overview but not the detailed task page.
- 🔎 **Dynamic Task Search**: Search for tasks by name in a case-insensitive manner, allowing users to quickly find tasks using a dynamic search bar.
